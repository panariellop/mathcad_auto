    - no localobj 
    - Mathcad's example doesn't work, which makes me think that the issue is with how Mathcad Prime 5.0 was installed on the VDI
    - Can create a virtual machine with windows installed as the operating system, then download mathcad and run the program from there
    - Download Mathcad Prime 4.0 and test if it works  
* Done
** CG in excel
    Set one of the inputs as center of gravity
