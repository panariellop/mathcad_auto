  + [ ] Updates from the developer side
    Want to just have to push code to github master branch 
  + [ ] Update feature 
	- Seperate program that gets bundled with the distribution
	- Updates the main program every time there are pushes to the main branch
	- Use the Github API to check if there are more recent versions of the applicaiton
	  + Find the push history to main branch using the Github API 
	  + Every time there is a push to the main branch, package it on the remote machine and store the executable in a bucket 
	  + Have a local updater program that can detect the version the user is running and if there are any more recent versions. If there are, then download the most recent version from the bucket and replace the current application. 
	  + Package the application remotely using a cloud machine - allow the most recent version of the executable to be download


* DONE Other updater idea
  1. Have a check for updates script run at startup, and alert the user if there is a more recent version of the software.
  2. Create a link to the releases tab in the github page
